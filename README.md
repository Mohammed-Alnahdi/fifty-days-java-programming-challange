# Fifty Days Java Programming Challenge
This repository I had made to remember everything about java.

## Introduction
When I was studying at university, my professor once advised me and said to me:
> “You must speak the languages ​​that you are proficient in so that you can speak them and not forget them, and you must also exercise your mind in the programming languages ​​that you master in order to keep up with the standards and not forget them.”
We used to solve these exercises within 50 days in the past, but here we will exceed this number.

## How Works.
Everyday, I am taking one question from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/) then solve it. 

### Note:
This repository for Java only.
